# VoxShift: State-of-Art Voice Conversion Model
Welcome to VoxShift, a university project that delves into the fascinating world of voice conversion. Our model strives to alter the vocal characteristics from one speaker to another while maintaining the clarity of the spoken message. The results from our experiments have been sometimes surprising, occasionally educational, and always a learning experience. We encourage you to check out the 'Demo' section, run the code, and engage in the discussions.
